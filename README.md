## UBC Scientific Software Seminar

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar is inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and its goal is to help students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC develop software skills for science.

### Fall 2016: Machine Learning in Python with scikit-learn

#### OUTLINE

* What are the **learning goals**?
  * To learn how to use [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org) to solve machine learning problems
  * To master [Python](https://www.python.org/) programming for scientific computing
  * To learn mathematics and statistics applied to data science and machine learning
  * To meet and collaborate with other students and faculty interested in scientific computing
* What **software tools** are we going to use?
  * [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/): machine learning in Python
  * [SciPy Stack](http://scipy.org/): scientific computing with [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/), [SciPy](http://scipy.org/), [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/) and [pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/)
  * [Python](https://www.python.org/)
  * [Jupyter Notebooks](http://jupyter.org/): execute code with accompanying text, markdown and LaTeX all in the browser
  * [Git/GitHub](https://github.com/): manage projects locally from the command line with Git and collaborate online with GitHub
* What **scientific topics** will we study?
  * Machine learning fundamentals (following [tutorials](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html) provided by [scikit-learn.org](http://scikit-learn.org/)):
    * Regression, classification, clustering, dimensionality reduction
  * Special topics:
    * [Natural Language Processing](http://www.nltk.org/)
* Where do we start? What are the **prerequisites**?
  * UBCS3 Fall 2016 is a continuation of [UBCS3 Summer 2016](https://github.com/ubcs3/2016-Summer) which included:
    * Bash shell
    * Git/GitHub
    * Python programming
    * SciPy stack: NumPy, Scipy, matplotlib and pandas
    * Basic examples using scikit-learn
  * Calculus, linear algebra, probability and statistics
* Who is the target **audience**?
  * Everyone is invited!
  * If the outline above is at your level, perfect! Get ready to write a lot of code!
  * If the outline above seems too intimidating, come anyway! You'll learn things just by being exposed to new tools and ideas, and meeting new people!
  * If you have experience with all the topics outlined above, come anyway! You'll become more of an expert by participating as a helper/instructor!

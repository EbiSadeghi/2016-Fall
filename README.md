## UBC Scientific Software Seminar - Fall 2016

The UBC Scientific Software Seminar is inspired by [Software Carpentry](http://software-carpentry.org/) and its goal is to help students, graduates, fellows and faculty at UBC develop software skills for science. The topic for the Fall 2016 semester is **Machine Learning in Python with scikit-learn** (see [scikit-learn.org](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)) and will be a continuation of UBCS3 Summer 2016 seminar (see the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/patrickwalls/ubc-scientific-software-seminar)). For Fall 2016, it is encouraged but not required (everyone is still invited!) for participants to be familiar with Python programming, Jupyter notebooks and the SciPy stack: NumPy, SciPy, matplotlib and pandas.
